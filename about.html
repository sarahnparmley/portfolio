        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p> Hi, I'm Sarah!</p> 
        <p> I got my start in design during high school and quickly realized it was more than just a hobby. As I worked toward my degree in Integrated Strategic Communication and Psychology at the University of Kentucky, I kept designing, taking on freelance projects that let me explore everything from branding and social content to UI and web design.</p>
        <p> Design has become the way I think through ideas and connect with people. Whether it's building out a brand, creating marketing visuals, or designing a clean user interface, I’m drawn to work that’s both thoughtful and visually strong.</p>
        <p> I’m always excited to take on new design projects, let’s chat.</p>
